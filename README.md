# Portuguese_banking_institution

*Project Introduction

In this project you will be provided with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

Now that you have your dataset , let us go through the problems one by one!

1.Section I : Data Loading
Part I : Load the dataset into the notebook
Part II : Explore and make note of Attribute Information from UCI
Part III : What is the significance of the y column in the dataset and what are the value counts of the y column?
Part IV : What is the ratio of the two classes ? Are they balanced ?

2.Section II : Data Cleaning
Since this is real world data , A good practice is to make sure the dataset is devoid of any nuances

Part I : Get the dtypes of all the columns of our dataset
Part II : Refering to the UCI data description , explore the data in your columns and check if there are any errors
Part III : Make note of the deviation in the dataset compared to the description provided by UCI
Part IV : Using Data Cleaning principles you learned from Pandas Tutorial) figure out the best ways to get rid of the dirty data Part V : Print the cleaned data

3.Section III : Exploring data with Group by
In this section , we must create some primitive EDA

Use the groupby function on the mean of the following columns :

I : y
II : job
III : marital
IV : education

Make a note of what you learn from the outputs !

Section III : Exploratory Data Analysis
Let us put Matplotlib to use !

Part I : Create bar graphs to the frequency of purchase with respect to the job , martial etc
Part II : Also create stacked bars to same data columns with respect to
Part III : Explore the age column using a histogram and note down your observations

4.Section IV : Categorical Variable Encoding

Part I : Create dummy variables for your categorial variables
part II : Explore your new dataset with these new dummy variables !

5.Section V : Preliminary Training

Part I : Import your Logisitc Regression libraries
Part II : Split your train and test dataset and train on the data
Part III : Make note of the classification report and other metrics

6.Section VI : Let's Improve the performance !

Part 0 : What was your answer to Section - Part IV? Do you think class imbalance affects the model performance? Explore SMOTE implementation

Part I : Make note of the performance from the last training
Part II : Try implementing SMOTE to balance the two class labels
Part III : Make note of the y label data now , what are the rations now ?

7.Section VII : Let us Re-Train!

Part I : Explore what RFE means
Part II : Implement your training process inside the RFE
Part III : What are the best columns that your RFE found? Please make a list of it

8.Section VIII : Training time !
Now that you have found the best columns for this problem

Part I : Now train the model with the new data you have created after the RFE
Part II : Create the prediction system to get the metrics such as accuracy

9.Section IX : Additional Metrics
Accuracy is not always the best metric

Part I : Explore what Confusion Matrix means
Part II : Create the confusion matrix for the predictions and make note of the outputs
Part III : Create a classification report and make note of various outputs

10.Section X : What's next?

Part I : Make a note of difference in performance?
Part II : Can you recommend more improvements that could give much better results in all metrics?
